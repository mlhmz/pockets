# Pockets
Categorize your savings account with ease

## Description
Pockets is an innovative application designed to categorize transactions within savings accounts into distinct categories known as "Pockets." 
For instance, if you are saving for a vacation while also setting aside funds for annual subscriptions, Pockets enables you to effectively monitor and manage your accumulated savings for each specific goal. 
This functionality allows users to maintain a clear overview of their financial progress and make informed decisions regarding their savings.

## Status
Currently, the application exclusively supports CSV files from the German bank "DKB" .
However, I am actively exploring multi-banking APIs to expand the application's capabilities and integrate support for additional banking institutions. 
This enhancement will provide users with greater flexibility and accessibility in managing their financial transactions.
